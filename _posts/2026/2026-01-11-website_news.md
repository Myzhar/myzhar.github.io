I'm excited to announce some recent updates to my website! I've added detailed project pages for the MyzharBot v1, v2, and v3, documenting their development, features, and challenges. These pages provide insights into the evolution of the MyzharBot series and the technologies involved. [Read more](/projects/).

Additionally, I've created a simple CUDA tutorial that explains CUDA Compute Capability, helping readers understand its significance in GPU programming and how to choose the right configuration when developing CUDA applications.
The tutorial replicates a popular post from my old WordPress blog, ensuring that valuable information remains accessible. [Check out the tutorial here](/tutorials/cuda-compute-capability/).

Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials in the future!
