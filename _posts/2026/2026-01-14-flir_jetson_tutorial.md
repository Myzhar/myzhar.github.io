I'm pleased to announce that I have restored the tutorial titled ["Thermal Images on Jetson™ Nano with FLIR Lepton3"](/tutorials/flir_lepton_on_jetson/).

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on how to interface the FLIR® Lepton3 thermal camera with the NVIDIA® Jetson embedded devices, covering everything from hardware connections to software setup and image processing.

The tutorial was originally published on my old WordPress blog, and I have ensured that all the valuable information is now accessible on my current site. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional working with embedded systems and thermal imaging, this guide will help you get started with the FLIR Lepton3 on the Jetson platform.

I took the opportunity to update some sections of the tutorial to reflect the latest software versions and best practices.

Do not hesitate to [follow it](/tutorials/flir_lepton_on_jetson/) and share your feedback. Happy coding and thermal imaging!
