After many years with **WordPress**, it’s time for a change. Managing a complex website has become more than I can handle alongside everything else in life, so I’ve decided to move to a simpler, cleaner solution — **GitHub Pages with Jekyll**.

Over the next few weeks, I’ll be migrating the most relevant content from the old site and sharing updates on the MyzharBot project, which continues to progress—slowly but surely.

Stay tuned for what’s next!
