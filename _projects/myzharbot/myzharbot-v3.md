## MyzharBot v3 - The Beginning of a New Era

In mid 2014, I embarked on developing MyzharBot's third version, upgrading from the [Pandaboard ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PandaBoard) to the [NVIDIA® Jetson TK1](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/jetson-tk1-mobile-embedded-supercomputer-cuda-everywhere/) as the main computer. My dream had finally materialized: NVIDIA® released a powerful CUDA-enabled embedded platform capable of running real-time computer vision on a small robot!

{% include gallery id="gallery_embedded" caption="Pandaboard ES vs NVIDIA® Jetson TK1" %}

{% include video id="8iJ-h96syKE" provider="youtube" %}

In September 2014, MyzharBot-v3.0 was operational, even if not yet fully autonomous. I exposed it at Maker Faire Rome. It was my first public appearance with the robot, and I was thrilled to showcase its new capabilities.

In December 2014, I received an unexpected Facebook message from an NVIDIA® representative. They were recruiting Jetson TK1 enthusiasts for a new program called [Jetson Champions](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-champions). Initially skeptical, it seemed too good to be true, I soon realized the opportunity was genuine. They had discovered my blog and wanted me to continue **sharing my knowledge and experience with the community** while developing projects using NVIDIA® Jetson platforms. **Nothing easier than that!**

## MyzharBot (and Me) on the Spotlight

Weeks later, NVIDIA® invited me to showcase MyzharBot at their GTC 2015 booth in San Jose, California. I was thrilled: my first trip to the USA, representing NVIDIA®, and demonstrating my robot to a global audience!

A new chapter was unfolding—a new robot, a powerful brain, and an exciting adventure ahead.

I was not alone on this journey; my old friend [Raffaello Bonghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raffaello-bonghi/) collaborated with me on the firmware for the motor driver board, ensuring seamless integration with the new system. For this reason, I asked NVIDIA® to invite him to GTC 2015 as well, and they gladly accepted. This was a great opportunity for Raffaello too, as he is now a Technical Marketing Engineer at NVIDIA®.

It was an unforgettable experience because we also had the chance to visit San Francisco for two full days after GTC, exploring the city and its iconic landmarks.

## Software Overhaul: Embracing ROS

Coincidentally, I decided to abandon my custom robotics framework and adopt [ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/) as MyzharBot's primary software platform. Whether it was [ROS Hydro or Indigo](https://wiki.ros.org/Distributions#List_of_Distributions), within weeks I replicated my previous functionality while leveraging ROS's extensive ecosystem. Most importantly, I could finally focus on **high-level robotics software** without worrying about low-level details like data communication, hardware abstraction, or control interfaces—ROS handled it all.

This was the first step toward full autonomous navigation. I implemented a node that allowed MyzharBot to safely navigate avoiding any kind of obstacle using data from the Asus Xtion Pro Live RGB-D camera (see below).

The source code is still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Myzhar/ros_robot_wandering_demo) in a fork of the original [ros_robot_wandering_demo](https://github.com/officinerobotiche/ros_robot_wandering_demo) repository that I published in Officine Robotiche's GitHub account, where I contributed as a founder and member in those years.

## Hardware Upgrades

The hardware received significant upgrades. I redesigned the laser-cut plastic chassis to accommodate the Jetson TK1 board and replaced the dual-webcam setup with an Asus Xtion Pro Live RGB-D camera. This addition provided depth information for obstacle detection and mapping at zero cost, thanks to the open-source [OpenNI](https://structure.io/openni) drivers.

## An Encounter That Changed My Life

At GTC 2015, during a lunch break while manning the NVIDIA® booth alone, a girl approached holding a silver stereo camera. [Cecile Schmollgruber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecile-schmollgruber-63563126/), co-founder and CEO of Stereolabs, introduced herself and her revolutionary product: the first [ZED Stereo Camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/). This high-resolution passive stereo camera featured perfect sensor synchronization and a powerful CUDA-accelerated SDK—a computer vision enthusiast's dream.

Cecile and [Edwin Azzam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinazzam/), another Stereolabs co-founder and CTO, were announcing the ZED's launch. Their SDK leveraged CUDA for real-time processing, generating high-resolution depth maps and point clouds with natively synchronized color information.

Fascinated by the ZED's potential for robotics, we exchanged contacts. I promised to connect them with the NVIDIA® team, and a few hours later A few hours later, I led one of the NVIDIA managers to their booth. This encounter sparked a long-lasting friendship and collaboration that led me to join Stereolabs in 2018 as a Senior Software Engineer, where I became a key ambassador and contributor to their products and SDKs.

**Spoiler alert**: the ZED camera was later integrated into MyzharBot-v4 :smile:

Below are two of the first ZED cameras released that Stereolabs donated to me after GTC to use with the next version of MyzharBot. They still work like jewels and I treasure them. Behind a Jetson Champion cup, I love using it for breakfast as a daily reminder of how far I've come since those early days.
