## The Beginning of a New Era

In 2014, I embarked on developing MyzharBot's third version, upgrading from the [BeagleBoard](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleboard) to the [NVIDIA® Jetson TK1](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/jetson-tk1-mobile-embedded-supercomputer-cuda-everywhere/) as the main computer. My dream had finally materialized: NVIDIA® released a powerful CUDA-enabled embedded platform capable of running real-time computer vision on a small robot!

![MyzharBot-v3.1.1](/assets/images/projects/myzharbot/v3/MyzharBot-v3.1.1-Myzhar.jpg "MyzharBot-v3.1.1 and me")

{% include gallery id="gallery_embedded" caption="BeagleBoard and NVIDIA® Jetson TK1" %}

In September 2014, MyzharBot-v3.0 was operational, and I exposed it at Maker Faire Rome 2014. It was my first public appearance with the robot, and I was thrilled to showcase its new capabilities.

In December 2014, I received an unexpected Facebook message from an NVIDIA® representative. They were recruiting Jetson TK1 enthusiasts for a new program called [Jetson Champions](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-champions). Initially skeptical—it seemed too good to be true—I soon realized the opportunity was genuine. They had discovered my blog and wanted me to continue **sharing my knowledge and experience with the community** while developing projects using NVIDIA® Jetson platforms. **Nothing easier than that!**

## MyzharBot (and Me) on the Spotlight

Weeks later, NVIDIA® invited me to showcase MyzharBot at their GTC 2015 booth in San Jose, California. I was thrilled: my first trip to the USA, representing NVIDIA®, and demonstrating my robot to a global audience!

A new chapter was unfolding—a new robot, a powerful brain, and an exciting adventure ahead.

I was not alone in this journey; my old friend [Raffaello Bonghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raffaello-bonghi/) worked with me on the firmware of the motor driver board, ensuring seamless integration with the new system. For this reason I asked NVIDIA® to invite him to GTC 2015 as well, and they gladly accepted. This was a good opportunity for Raffaello too, as he is now a Technical Marketing Engineer at NVIDIA®.

![Raffaello, doing Raffaello things](/assets/images/projects/myzharbot/v3/20150315_175912.jpg "Raffaello, doing Raffaello things")

It was an unforgettable experience, because we also had the change to visit San Francisco for two full days after GTC, exploring the city and its iconic landmarks.

## Software Overhaul: Embracing ROS

Coincidentally, I decided to abandon my custom robotics framework and adopt [ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://www.ros.org/) as MyzharBot's primary software platform. Whether it was [ROS Hydro or Indigo](https://wiki.ros.org/Distributions#List_of_Distributions), within weeks I replicated my previous functionality while leveraging ROS's extensive ecosystem. Most importantly, I could finally focus on **high-level robotics software** without worrying about low-level details like data communication, hardware abstraction, or control interfaces—ROS handled it all.

## Hardware Upgrades

The hardware received significant upgrades. I redesigned the laser-cut plastic chassis to accommodate the Jetson TK1 board and replaced the dual-webcam setup with an Asus Xtion Pro Live RGB-D camera. This addition provided depth information for obstacle detection and mapping at zero cost, thanks to the open-source [OpenNI](https://structure.io/openni) drivers.

## An Encounter That Changed My Life

At GTC 2015, during a lunch break while manning the NVIDIA® booth alone, a girl approached holding a silver stereo camera. [Cecile Schmollgruber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecile-schmollgruber-63563126/), co-founder and CEO of Stereolabs, introduced herself and her revolutionary product: the first [ZED Stereo Camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/). This high-resolution passive stereo camera featured perfect sensor synchronization and a powerful CUDA-accelerated SDK—a computer vision enthusiast's dream.

Cecile and [Edwin Azzam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwinazzam/), another Stereolabs co-founder and CTO, were announcing the ZED's launch. Their SDK leveraged CUDA for real-time processing, generating high-resolution depth maps and point clouds with natively synchronized color information.

Fascinated by the ZED's potential for robotics, we exchanged contacts. I promised to connect them with the NVIDIA® team, and a few hours later A few hours later, I led one of the NVIDIA managers to their booth. This encounter sparked a long-lasting friendship and collaboration that led me to join Stereolabs in 2018 as a Senior Software Engineer, where I became a key ambassador and contributor to their products and SDKs.

**Spoiler alert**: the ZED camera was later integrated into MyzharBot-v3 :smile:

Below are two of the first ZED cameras released that Stereolabs donated to me after GTC to use with the next version of MyzharBot. They still work like jewels and I treasure them. Behind a Jetson Champion cup, I love using it for breakfast as a daily reminder of how far I've come since those early days.
