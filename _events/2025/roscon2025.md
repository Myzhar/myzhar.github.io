On October 22-24, 2025, I had the opportunity to attend [ROSCon 2025 in Singapore](https://roscon.ros.org/2025/), representing [Stereolabs](https://www.stereolabs.com) as a sponsor and exhibitor. It was an incredible experience to connect with the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) community and showcase our latest advancements in robotics technology.

It was my first time attending ROSCon, and I was thrilled to be part of such a prestigious event. The conference featured a variety of talks, workshops, and networking opportunities that highlighted the latest developments in the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) ecosystem.

During the event, I had the chance to meet with fellow robotics enthusiasts, developers, and industry experts. The atmosphere was vibrant, filled with innovative ideas and collaborative spirit. Stereolabs' booth attracted a lot of attention, and I was proud to demonstrate our cutting-edge solutions that leverage [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) for enhanced robotic capabilities.

Overall, ROSCon 2025 was an unforgettable experience that reinforced my passion for robotics and the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) community. I look forward to attending future events and continuing to contribute to the exciting world of robotics.
