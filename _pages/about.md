Welcome to my personal space — I’m Walter Alex Lucetti, an Italian computer engineer and technical leader specializing in **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **artificial intelligence**. This site brings together years of my work on autonomous systems, stereo vision, and real-world robotics projects, along with practical tutorials and experiments for developers and enthusiasts.

## Who I Am

Known online as *Myzhar*, I work at the intersection of software engineering and robotics, designing systems that can see, understand, and move through the world. My expertise spans stereo vision, 3D perception, embedded systems, and AI-driven autonomy, with a strong focus on NVIDIA Jetson platforms, CUDA, and ROS/ROS 2.

I currently serve as a **Senior Software Engineer at [Stereolabs](http://www.stereolabs.com)**, where I contribute to stereo vision and 3D perception products such as the ZED SDK, support developers integrating depth cameras into robots, and help define best practices for spatial AI applications.

## My Robotics Projects

At the heart of my work is **MyzharBot**, my intelligent tracked mobile robot used as a development and experimentation platform for autonomous navigation, computer vision, and AI-based obstacle avoidance. Largely **3D-printed** and powered by embedded GPU hardware, MyzharBot embodies my approach: hands-on, open, and focused on turning advanced algorithms into working robots.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to several open-source and community projects, including humanoid and mobile robots, thermal imaging systems such as the “SmarTC – Smart Thermal Camera”, and ROS drivers and tools for depth and stereo sensors. These projects reflect my belief that complex robotics should be **accessible**, **documented**, and **shareable**.

## What You’ll Find Here

On this website, I:

- Document the evolution of **MyzharBot** and its different versions over the years.
- Share **tutorials** on robotics, computer vision, AI, and 3D printing.
- Publish notes, experiments, and lessons learned from real robots, sensors, and software stacks.
- Provide resources and examples for developers working with stereo cameras, ROS/ROS 2, and embedded GPU systems.

The site is progressively evolving toward a **lightweight, static-friendly setup** to reduce maintenance and make it easier to publish clear, focused technical content.

## My Tools and Technologies

My daily toolbox includes:

- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **Frameworks:** ROS, ROS 2, OpenCV
- **Platforms:** NVIDIA Jetson and embedded Linux systems
- **Acceleration:** CUDA and GPU-optimized perception pipelines
- **Fabrication:** 3D printing for robot parts and practical everyday objects

These technologies come together in projects that mix research ideas with practical engineering, aiming for systems that are not only clever in theory but reliable in real-world scenarios.

## My Philosophy

Behind every project on this site is a simple idea: **robots should help people, and knowledge should be shared**. I enjoy mentoring, writing documentation, and helping others debug, learn, and build, both through my blog and through my presence in robotics communities such as [Pizza Robotics](http://pizzarobotics.org) and various online forums.

By publishing my work openly, I aim to:

- Lower the barrier to entry for robotics and AI.
- Give other engineers and enthusiasts solid starting points for their own projects.
- Show how advanced perception and autonomy can be implemented on real hardware.

If you’re interested in robots that truly *see* and interact with the world, this is where you can follow my journey — and, hopefully, build along with me.
